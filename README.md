This Boilerplate have a basic CRUD operation with MySQL, authetication of API endpoint with JWT Token and Validation of request and response of each route. It contained a documentation folder which contain swagger documentation easy for front-end developer to use and understand. It contained Pm2 which helps to restart, reload and monitor application in production, provides zero downtime availability. It has Nodemailer which will send email. It has bcrypt module which will encrypt password and make it more secure. It contain Artillery for load testing.

2. `$ npm install`
3. Launch Enviornment:
    * `$ node app.js or nodemon app.js`
4. In Cluster mode with the help of pm2 [optional step]:
    * `$ pm2 start app.js or pm2 start app.js -i <no of instances>`
5. Open in browser:
    * open `http://localhost:9890`



# API Usage 

1. signup route - `http://localhost:9890/api/signup`
     * pass json object contain username and password.

2. you can use artillery in 2 way :-
   * by hardcoding data in yml file.
   * getting data by `.csv` file.
3. For option 1 run - `artillery run hello.yml`
4. For option 2 first get CSV file with data.
5. define path in yml file and run example as i Did :- `artillery run hellocsv.yml`
